IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Curtobacterium_GRASS-7 and Curtobacterium_sp_Leaf183|17362913 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 876 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 15 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file protein_S13p.good.final.aln.reduced

Alignment has 15 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 216
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: AA
Substitution Matrix: WAG
Using empirical base frequencies




RAxML was called as follows:
